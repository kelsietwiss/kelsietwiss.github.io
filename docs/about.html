                            <h2>Kelsie Twiss</h2>
                        <p>Hi there, Iâ€™m Kelsie. I am a full-stack web developer with experience in Python, 
                            HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am currently attending PDX Code Guilds Full-Stack 
                            bootcamp course, in addition to teaching myself C++ in my free 
                            time.</p> 

                        <p>I am an optimistic person with unshakable confidence in my abilities to problem-solve, 
                            make plans, and implement solutions. I truly believe that anything is achievable with 
                            dedication and creativity. I am a big-picture strategic thinker with strong organizational 
                            and planning abilities, and I am driven by challenges, a passion for learning, and a 
                            powerful curiosity about the world around us.</p>
                            
                        <p>As a team member, I am highly empathetic and can put myself in othersâ€™ shoes and understand 
                            different perspectives. I strive to be a clear communicator, helpful and positive, and I 
                            believe that being a part of a team requires flexibility and dedication. </p>
                            
                        <p>As the Owner/Artist of Wild Heart Art Shop, I have extensive experience in delivering 
                            exceptional customer service, providing timely responses to inquiries, and creating and 
                            delivering hand-crafted gifts. Many of the skills I have developed organically through 
                            my business experience, such as balancing multiple projects and clients, time management, 
                            and interpersonal skills, transfer well to the creative fields of web design and game 
                            development.</p>
                        <p> I am a mom to three awesome kids, I go hiking throughout the beautiful Pacific 
                            Northwest every chance I get, I am a big reader (a recent favorite is "The Particular Sadness of 
                            Lemon Cake" by Aimee Bender), and I love cooking new foods and working in my garden.</p>
